Yes, your explanation of 6 blocks in EXT4_XATTR_TRANS_BLOCKS looks good.
But I still wonder why we count with modification of xattrs for each data
block write. EXT4_XATTR_TRANS_BLOCKS was added to EXT4_DATA_TRANS_BLOCKS
back at the times when it was still ext3 and we have added xattr support to
ext3. Looking at places where EXT4_DATA_TRANS_BLOCKS is used (mostly in
fs/ext4/namei.c when adding entry into a directory), this was probably to
account for a fact that when we create new inode, we may be cloning or
otherwise modifying xattr block as well. So it seems that
EXT4_DATA_TRANS_BLOCKS has somewhat misleading name (it should rather be
called EXT4_INODE_CREATE_BLOCKS or something like that) but in principle we
indeed need to count with xattr block modifications. Anyway, that's for a
separate cleanup.
