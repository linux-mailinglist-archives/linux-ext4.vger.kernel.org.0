Out of thousand machines, one would trigger the problem about every 1 to 
10 days. Some machines trigger the problem much often than others. So I 
can say that we have a way to verify quickly if applying the patch will 
fix this for us.

The most important question is: Is it safe to apply the patch on 
production machines with kernel 4.14?

We can't risk data loss. And I lack the expertise to asses what risks 
this small patch brings.

Best regards.
