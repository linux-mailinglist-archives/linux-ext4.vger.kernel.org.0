The servers are hosting hundreds of users who run their own tasks and we 
have no control nor a way to closely observe their usage pattern. Unless 
you point us in a direction to debug this somehow.

"data=journaled" is definitely in place for all servers.

We already tried different parallel combinations of mmap()'ed reading, 
direct and regular write(), drop_caches, sync(), etc. but we can't 
trigger the panic.

If you have any suggestions what we should try next as a reproducer, 
please share and we will try to implement and execute it.

Did I understand correctly that a possible reproducer would be a loop of 
heavy write() followed by truncate() of the same file? Should we 
randomly sync() and/or "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" to increase 
the chance of hitting the bug?

Best regards.
