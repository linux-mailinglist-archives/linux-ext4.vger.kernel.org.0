They *did* way back in the day, I worked with some seekrit PPC440s early
in my career.  I don't know that any of them still exist, but the code
is still there...

We don't allow mmapping file data beyond the EOF basepage, even if the
underlying folio is a large folio.  See generic/749, though recently
Kiryl Shutsemau tried to remove that restriction[1], until dchinner and
willy told him no.

I'm concerned that post-eof zeroing of a 256k folio could accidentally
obliterate merkle tree content that was somehow previously loaded.
Though afaict from the existing codebases, none of them actually make
that mistake.

I'd leave the ondisk offset as-is, but change the pagecache offset to
roundup(i_size_read(), mapping_max_folio_size_supported()) just to keep
file data and fsverity metadata completely separate.

The roundup() formula above is what I'd choose for the pagecache offset
for xfs.  The ondisk offset of 1<<53 is ok with me.
