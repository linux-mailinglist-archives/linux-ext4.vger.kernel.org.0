Ah, ok. With data=ordered and expanding within the last block, you are
right you can see zeros at the end of the file after a crash. We were
discussing this in the past already but decided not to improve this because
the fix would have performance cost we didn't want to impose on users.

Yeah, I agree. The time window is not small. What we could do and what
could even bring some performance benefit is if we moved the i_disksize
update from ext4_da_write_end() to ext4_do_writepages(). Currently we do
the i_disksize update only in mpage_map_and_submit_extent() but we could
add a similar logic when exiting from ext4_do_writepages() to update
i_disksize for written back pages beyond i_disksize which didn't need block
allocation. *Except* there is a problem that we couldn't do this i_disksize
update when the pages are written from jbd2 during ordered data writeback
(we cannot start transaction in that context). And this is nasty because
we will completely loose the i_disksize update. We could handle it by
redirtying the tail page in this case but it gets a bit ugly...
