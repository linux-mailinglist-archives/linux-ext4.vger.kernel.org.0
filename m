This patch series adds support for fast commits which is a simplified
version of the scheme proposed by Park and Shin, in their paper,
"iJournaling: Fine-Grained Journaling for Improving the Latency of
Fsync System Call"[1]. The basic idea of fast commits is to make JBD2
give the client file system an opportunity to perform a faster
commit. Only if the file system cannot perform such a commit
operation, then JBD2 should fall back to traditional commits.

Because JBD2 operates at block granularity, for every file system
metadata update it commits all the changed blocks are written to the
journal at commit time. This is inefficient because updates to some
blocks that JBD2 commits are derivable from some other blocks. For
example, if a new extent is added to an inode, then corresponding
updates to the inode table, the block bitmap, the group descriptor and
the superblock can be derived based on just the extent information and
the corresponding inode information. So, if we take this relationship
between blocks into account and replay the journalled blocks smartly,
we could increase performance of file system commits significantly.

Fast commits introduced in this patch have two main contributions:

(1) Making JBD2 fast commit aware, so that clients of JBD2 can
    implement fast commits

(2) Add support in ext4 to use JBD2's new interfaces and implement
    fast commits.

Ext4 supports two modes of fast commits: 1) fast commits with hard
consistency guarantees 2) fast commits with soft consistency guarantees

When hard consistency is enabled, fast commit guarantees that all the
updates will be committed. After a successful replay of fast commits
blocks in hard consistency mode, the entire file system would be in
the same state as that when fsync() returned before crash. This
guarantee is similar to what jbd2 gives with full commits.

With soft consistency, file system only guarantees consistency for the
inode in question. In this mode, file system will try to write as less
data to the backend as possible during the commit time. To be precise,
file system records all the data updates for the inode in question and
directory updates that are required for guaranteeing consistency of the
inode in question.

In our evaluations, fast commits with hard consistency performed
better than fast commits with soft consistency. That's because with
hard consistency, a fast commit often ends up committing other inodes
together, while with soft consistency commits get serialized. Future
work can look at creating hybrid approach between the two extremes
that are there in this patchset.

Testing
-------

e2fsprogs was updated to set fast commit feature flag and to ignore
fast commit blocks during e2fsck.

https://github.com/harshadjs/e2fsprogs.git

After applying all the patches in this series, following runs of
xfstests were performed:

- kvm-xfstest.sh -g log -c 4k
- kvm-xfstests.sh smoke

All the log tests were successful and smoke tests didn't introduce any
additional failures.

Performance Evaluation
----------------------

Ext4 file system performance was tested with full commits, with fast
commits with soft consistency and with fast commits with hard
consistency. fs_mark benchmark showed that depending on the file size,
performance improvement was seen up to 50%. Soft fast commits performed
slightly worse than hard fast commits. But soft fast commits ended up
writing slightly lesser number of blocks on disk.

Changes since V4:

- Rebased on top of v5.6-rc3
- Fixed inode handling due to changed ext4_add_nondir()

+Fast Commits
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Ext4 also implements fast commits and integrates it with JBD2 journalling.
+Fast commits store metadata changes made to the file system as inode level
+diff. In other words, each fast commit block identifies updates made to
+a particular inode and collectively they represent total changes made to
+the file system.
+
+A fast commit is valid only if there is no full commit after that particular
+fast commit. Because of this feature, fast commit blocks can be reused by
+the following transactions.
+
+Each fast commit block stores updates to 1 particular inode. Updates in each
+fast commit block are one of the 2 types:
+- Data updates (add range / delete range)
+- Directory entry updates (Add / remove links)
+
+Fast commit blocks must be replayed in the order in which they appear on disk.
+That's because directory entry updates are written in fast commit blocks
+in the order in which they are applied on the file system before crash.
+Changing the order of replaying for directory entry updates may result
+in inconsistent file system. Note that only directory entry updates need
+ordering, data updates, since they apply to only one inode, do not require
+ordered replay. Also, fast commits guarantee that file system is in consistent
+state after replay of each fast commit block as long as order of replay has
+been followed.
+
+Note that directory inode updates are never directly recorded in fast commits.
+Just like other file system level metaata, updates to directories are always
+implied based on directory entry updates stored in fast commit blocks.
+
+Based on which directory entry updates are committed with an inode, fast
+commits have two modes of operation:
+
+- Hard Consistency (default)
+- Soft Consistency (can be enabled by setting mount flag "fc_soft_consistency")
+
+When hard consistency is enabled, fast commit guarantees that all the updates
+will be committed. After a successful replay of fast commits blocks
+in hard consistency mode, the entire file system would be in the same state as
+that when fsync() returned before crash. This guarantee is similar to what
+jbd2 gives.
+
+With soft consistency, file system only guarantees consistency for the
+inode in question. In this mode, file system will try to write as less data
+to the backed as possible during the commit time. To be precise, file system
+records all the data updates for the inode in question and directory updates
+that are required for guaranteeing consistency of the inode in question.
