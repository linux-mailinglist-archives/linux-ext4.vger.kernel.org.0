Greeting

I am Dr Joel Nikiema, I currently hold the post as the Audit Account
Manager of our bank in Ouagadougou Branch,Burkina Faso.

 I got your contact from a reliable web directory. After much
consideration In developed the trust on you after one week of fasting
and praying.

Due to the trust, I made up my mind to disclose this confidential
business to you.We are in position to reclaim and inherit the sum of
US$15.8 Million Dollars without any trouble or hindrance from a
dormant account which remains unclaimed since 7 years ago, the owner
of this account died.

This is a U.S Dollar=E2=80=99s account and the beneficiary died without tra=
ce
of his family or relatives to claim the fund.

I am looking for a reliable business partner to present for the
inheritance, This may not be your area of business but it will be
another income and benefit for both of us; I will give you more
specific profit details when I receive feedback from you if you are
interested.

Warm Regards
 Dr Joel Nikiema,
77577886
