Yes, which is fine, but you are responding to a CVE report, NOT to a
stable kernel patch that has been backported, which is what I think you
want to respond to, right?

It's fine, I'm just trying to get you to route it to a group of people
that can do something about it.  Again, try responding to the stable
patch that was merged there, that would be better, along with perhaps
providing a patch showing what you feel should be done.

If patches that are assigned CVEs later get reverted, the CVEs should
semi-automatically be rejected (I swept the CVE tree for this last
week), so you don't need to worry about that happening.
