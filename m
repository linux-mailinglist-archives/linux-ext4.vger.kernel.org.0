We actually had a separate locking mechanism in ext4 code to avoid stale
data exposure during hole punch when unlocked DIO reads were running. But
it was kind of ugly and making things complex. I agree we need to move ext4
DIO path conversion further to avoid taking exclusive lock when we won't
actually need it.
