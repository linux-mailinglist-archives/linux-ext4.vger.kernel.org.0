It depends on the writing behavior (proportion of partial block write), I had
test fio sequence write with bs=1K[1] on the default 4K block size file system
(the cases were not enough, I hope that will be helpful to you), it's have
about 30% degradation at that time. I haven't test it recently, maybe it could
have more degradation than before at the delayed allocation write since we
removed the journal handling. Or you can test it on your products.

Thanks,
Yi.
