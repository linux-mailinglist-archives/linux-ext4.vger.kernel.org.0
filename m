Regardless of dioread_nolock, ext4_direct_IO_read() is taking
inode_lock_shared() across the direct IO call.  And writes in ext4
_always_ take the inode_lock() in ext4_file_write_iter(), even
though it gets dropped quite early when overwrite && dioread_nolock
is set.  But just taking the lock exclusively in write fro a short
while is enough to kill all shared locking concurrency...

If the write lock is also shared, then there should not be a
scalability issue. The shared dio locking is only half-done in ext4,
so perhaps comparing your workload against XFS would be an
informative exercise...

Cheers,

Dave.
