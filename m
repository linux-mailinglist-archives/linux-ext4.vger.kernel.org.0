Well, first bear in mind that in data=journal mode, ext4 does not support
direct IO so all the IO is in fact buffered. So your random-write workload
will be transformed to semilinear writeback of the page cache pages. Now 
I think given your SSD storage this performs much better because the
journalling thread commiting data will drive large IOs (IO to the journal
will be sequential) and even when the journal is filled and we have to
checkpoint, we will run many IOs in parallel which is beneficial for SSDs.
Whereas without data journalling your fio job will just run one IO at a
time which is far from utilizing full SSD bandwidth.

So to summarize you see better results with data journalling because you in
fact do buffered IO under the hood :).
