It seems that the case you've mentioned is intra-block append write (no?),
current data=ordered mount option doesn't work in this case because
ext4_map_blocks() doesn't attach inode to the t_inode_list of the running
transaction. If delayed allocation were disabled, the lose data window is still
there, because ext4_write_end()->ext4_update_inode_size() is also updating
i_disksize before writing data back. This is at least guarantee no store data.
We had discussed this in [1].
