Yes.  After we get the inode from __ext4_iget, I think it doesn't matter
if the user went behind our back straight to the block device and
changed the superblock to remove the feature bit. If we already loaded
->s_encoding, it won't be unloaded, so only checking at ext4_iget should
be enough, as far as I can tell.
