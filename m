Hey.

What about a direct write (like a pointer to HD area... *hd = Stuff ), 
in ext3 ? If it is because of buffering (and that means its buffering 
because of a HD)

what about usb and tape drives ? Also since each HD is different, how do 
you know how many bytes a buffer must have...where is best to write on 
track....if there is a crash, what happened to the buffer?


i guess this analogy is correct


A man is sitting on a room, in a chair, writing a piece of 
paper....normally the writing is sequentally...why does he needs to hold 
the writing ...and then write what it thoughts ?? why not just keep 
writing?! What if he does hold the writing, will he remember what he 
thought? Where has he ended last time?! (and again , if its not a HD, 
but another device?!)


Sorry for the lame comparision, but its a free world :)


best regards

andre
