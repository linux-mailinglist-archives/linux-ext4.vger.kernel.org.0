Yes, if I recall correctly it was intended to be the "largest reasonable
page size".  It looks like PAGE_SIZE > 65536 can't work as-is, so indeed
we should disable fsverity support in that configuration.

I don't think large folios are quite as problematic.
ext4_read_merkle_tree_page() and f2fs_read_merkle_tree_page() read a
folio and return the appropriate page in it, and fs/verity/verify.c
operates on the page.  If it's a page in the folio that spans EOF, I
think everything will actually still work, except userspace will be able
to see Merkle tree data after a 64K boundary past EOF if the file is
mmapped using huge pages.

The mmap issue isn't great, but I'm not sure how much it matters,
especially when the zeroes do still go up to a 64K boundary.

If we do need to fix this, there are a couple things we could consider
doing without changing the on-disk format in ext4 or f2fs: putting the
data in the page cache at a different offset than it exists on-disk, or
using "small" pages for EOF specifically.

But yes, XFS should choose a larger alignment than 64K.
