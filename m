Well, it's either

1a. Remove the user's handle.
	OR 
1b. Remove all users' handles.  (FSCRYPT_REMOVE_KEY_FLAG_ALL_USERS)

Then

2. If no handles remain, try to evict all inodes that use the key.

By "purge all keys" do you mean step (2)?  Note that it doesn't require root by
itself; root is only required to remove other users' handles (1b).

It could be argued that (2) should be a separate ioctl, so we'd have UNLINK_KEY
then LOCK_KEY.  But is there a real use case for this split?  I.e. would anyone
ever want to UNLINK_KEY without also LOCK_KEY?  Is that really something we
want/need to support?  I'd really like the API to be as straightforward as
possible for the normal use case of locking a directory, and not require some
series of multiple ioctl's, which would be more difficult to use correctly.

Shouldn't "fscrypt lock" still remove the user's handle, as opposed to refuse to
do anything, though?  So it would still need to call
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY, and could get the status from it rather than also
needing to call FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS.

Though, FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS would be needed if we wanted to show
the specific count of other users.

Do you mean use a positive return value, or do you mean add an output field to
the struct passed to the ioctl?

The latter might be more error-prone, since it invites bugs where a directory
silently fails to be locked, because the second field was not checked.

Either way note that it doesn't really need to be a bitfield, since you can't
have both statuses at the same time.  I.e. if there are still other users, we
couldn't have even gotten to checking for in-use files.

Yes, in any case the FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY documentation needs
improvement.  I have some updates pending for it.
