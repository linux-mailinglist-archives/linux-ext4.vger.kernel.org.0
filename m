Hi There,

How are you doing? I am sorry to have contacted you this way but it is a matter of great urgency. I seek your partnership on an important business transaction which will be of great benefit to both of us. I seek to work with you to claim as next of kin to
late John Shumejda who died in a plane crash some years back, You can read more about his death on the BBC news link below:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1742404.stm

Write to me on:
( evergreen5565343@gmail.com ) and we can talk more about this.


Yours faithfully.
Mr. Ronald Evergreen,
Financial Officer.
