This patchset gets encryption working with subpage blocksize by making
relevant changes in the generic code (i.e. do_mpage_readpage() and
block_read_full_page()) and removing duplicate code from ext4
(i.e. ext4_readpage() and friends). Without these changes the only way to get
subpage blocksize support was to add more duplicate code into Ext4 i.e. import
a copy of block_read_full_page() into Ext4 and make necessary edits to support
encryption.

So this patchset actually does help in removing exiting duplicate code in Ext4
and also prevents addition of more such code.

I am not sure if read callbacks can be made flexible enough to support the
above use cases. fscrypt and fsverity already provide workqueues and any new
post processing code added should follow the same convention. I see
that F2FS use case is special since,
1. It uses its own workqueues.
2. Decompression code inside F2FS isn't written as an FS independent subsystem
   like how fscrypt and fsverity are implemented.

To summarize, I believe the users of read callbacks should follow the
conventions set by fscrypt/fsverity and new post processing code that needs to
be plugged into read callbacks should provide APIs similar to
fscrypt/fsverity. Otherwise the state machine logic implemented by read
callbacks will get complex/convoluted.
