Greeetings from Mali. I am sorry for contacting you like this but=20
I do have a very urgent matter that I want to discuss with you.=20
Before I proceed, I want you to keep an open mind while reading=20
this proposal. My name is Moussa Traore, I am the Personal=20
Assistant to Mr. Issa Saley Maiga who was the head of the civil=20
aviation agency in Mali during the tenure of Ibrahim Boubacar=20
Ke=C3=AFta, the former president of Mali. His tenure was overtaken by=20
the military during a coup d'etat. I am sure you would have read=20
about this in your country because it was covered by the=20
international news agencies worldwide. 

Anyway, my boss was also affected by the coup d'etat and he was=20
arrested along with other high profile politicians. Also, all of=20
his local assets (bother property and financial assets) were=20
seized by the Government. Due to this situation, my boss belives=20
that he is at risk and he is now very scared for the safety of=20
his family especially his wife and kids. In order to ensure that=20
his family is taken care of and protected incase anything happens=20
to him, he has asked me to help him find a foreign investor who=20
can help him accommodate and manage the finanical assets that he=20
has in Europe. These assets was secured with the help of a proxy=20
and it is currently held with an offshore financial bank so it is=20
safe so secure. Also, the Government of his country do not know=20
of this asset hence why they are unable to seize it as they have=20
done his other assets.

My proposal to you is for you to help us manage these funds, and=20
invest it in lucrative projects in your country that will yeild=20
good profits. You also do not have to worry about if this is safe=20
or not because everything will be handled in a legal and=20
transparent manner. You will also be handosmely rewarded for your=20
help if you decide to work with us. If this proposal interests=20
you, please kindly respond so that I can give you more details. I=20
hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,

Moussa.
