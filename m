Right, XFS does not use the VFS inode writeback code at all - we
track all metadata changes internally via journalling. The VFS uses
I_DIRTY_SYNC to indicate and inode is metadata dirty and a writeback
candidate. Hence if we need to mark an inode dirty for integrity
purposes for _any reason_, then I_DIRTY_SYNC is the correct flag to
be passing to ->dirty_inode.

Dave.
