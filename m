Yeah, sorry, I didn't see it since it was in an attachment as opposed
to with an explicit [PATCH] subject line.

And at this point, the data=journal writeback patches have landed in
the ext4/dev tree, and while we could try to see if we could land this
before the next merge window, I'm worried about merge or semantic
conflicts of having both patches in a tree at one time.

I guess we could send it to Linus, let it get backported into stable,
and then revert it during the merge window, ahead of applying the
data=journal cleanup patch series.  But that seems a bit ugly.  Or we
could ask for an exception from the stable kernel folks, after I do a
full set of xfstests runs on it.  (Of course, I don't think anyone has
been able to create a reliable reproducer, so all we can do is to test
for regression failures.)

Jan, Greg, what do you think?
