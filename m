with his entire family in a plane crash

Hence; I am inviting you for a business deal where this money can be
shared between us in the ratio of 60/40 if you agree to my business
proposal. Further details of the transfer will be forwarded to you as
soon as I receive your return mail as soon as you receive this letter.

Please indicate your willingness by sending the below information for
more clarification and easy communication.
