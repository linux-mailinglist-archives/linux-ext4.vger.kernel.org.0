Actually, we discovered the mechanism change introduced by its fix patch
while analyzing CVE-2024-50191.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/22d652f6-cb3c-43f5-b2fe-0a4bb6516a04@huawei.com/T/#u

However, the situation is worse for 5.15 and 6.1, as the patch upon which
the fix depends has not even been merged yet. Therefore, I am replying here
to prevent the erroneous information from further propagating with the CVE.

The problem I've reported to the ext4 mail list, and perhaps some patches
will be synchronized to stable if anything comes of the discussion in the
link above.

Thank you for your maintenance!

This CVE is indeed a problem, so it's not necessary to reject it.
What I can say for sure now is that the 5.15 and 6.1 fixes are problematic.
The final solution needs some more discussion.
